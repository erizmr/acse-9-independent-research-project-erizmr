## Introduction
A network for end-to-end fluid flow inference called Particle-Net is presented in this project. The Particle-Net is able to infer the flow velocity field for shallow water problems from images of advected particles. Particle-Net outperforms the state-of-the-art particle image velocimetry (PIV) software PIVlab on synthetic data sets, both in terms of accuracy and efficiency, especially on extremely low-quality particle images. The root means square error and relative error of Particle-Net inference result are $60\%$ lower than that of PIVlab. In addition, even though Particle-Net was trained using only synthetic data, it still shows a promising ability to infer flow fields from real lab data even with sparse particles, although it does not outperform PIVlab on all lab data. Particle-Net processes images 25 times faster than PIVlab and is able to process nearly 72 pairs per second, which is quite promising for real-time fluid flow inference.
